# ABET-Website
Here is where you will find all of the files I wrote to develop a website that keeps track of student outcomes on a per-course basis, as well as the assessments used in determining if a student has met that outcome. On the front end is HTML/CSS, but on the backend is PHP, MySQL, and Javascript. Also worth noting is that this project originally started out as a final project for my Databases and Scripting Languages class at UTK, for which I got a 93 on, but I would like to continue working and building on this when I have the time.
