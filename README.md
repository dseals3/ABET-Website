# ABET-Website
Originally a project for my Databases & Scripting Languages class in Spring 2021, this is where you will find all of the files I wrote to develop a website that keeps track of student outcomes, the number of students that met or did not meet those outcomes, assessments and their weight, as well as notes on the strengths or weaknesses of the students, and this is all done on a per-course basis.

Unfortunately this website does not currently work because the MySQL databases for the course have been shut down, so I will have to set up a new database so that this website can be back up and running. For now, though, I have posted the files here to be viewed.

On the front end is HTML/CSS, but on the backend is PHP, MySQL, and Javascript. Now that the class is over, I know that I can do better, so I plan to continue working and building on this when I have the time.
